          <h3>Leohnart - fevrier 2021</h3>
          <p>
            For my very first project after school, I had the chance to build
            the new website of the artist LEOHNART!
          </p>
          <p>
            We were looking for something easy to handle and update, offering
            the artist the chance to introduce him-self, expose is work and play
            his music to the world. This project's been really exciting and
            instructive to work on, as I handled it entirely, from the design to
            the development; and as we decided to build it using Worldpress.
            This strategy would give to LEOHNART the ownership of his website
            after my job's done, Worldpress being user-friendly enough when it
            will be time for him to upload new albums or new tracks.

          <h3>My Portfolio - Septembre 2020</h3>
          <p>
            I have designed my own portfolio on Figma, and built it as a single
            page application with the static-site generator Gatsby.
          </p>
          <p>
            I plan to improve its aesthetics as I progress with CSS, javascript,
            React and pluggins libraries, by regularly adding new effects and
            animations here and there.
